A lot of this was a refresher for me from the beginning of the Intro to Programming Nanodegree. Though the hardest part was for me to remember how to make a line through the page by using the <hr> tag. Most of this has been easy so far. When I couldnâ€™t find the solution for the line horizontally through the page on the MDN resource I used one of the strategies I wrote down, which was to use a search engine to find the answer I was looking for.
