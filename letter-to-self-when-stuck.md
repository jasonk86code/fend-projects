## Things to remember when I'm stuck

Dear Jason,

If you're stuck, here are things to remember:
1. Use a search engine to find helpful information or search/post directly on a forum like Stack Overflow.
2. Get it on paper and/or draw it out.
3. Sleep on it.

If you're really stuck, here are things to remember:
1. You can reach out to people on forums.
2. You can try to reach out to folks at Udacity.
3. You have friendly engineers at work who would probably be happy to help as well as it being a good opportunity to interact with each other.

Don't forget the things you've already accomplished:
1. Intro to CS/Python college course.
2. Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree.
3. Tkinter link transposer.
4. Google Cloud hosted Stage 4 Notes web page (http://stage-4-notes-1176.appspot.com/).
5. Github Udacity Course.
6. Editing company site using Git and Github (https://affinity.co/)
7. Deploying company site.

I think what really helps me get through the hard times when I get stuck is to remember how far I've come. Every new piece of knowledge makes me feel one step closer to being a more proficient programmer. I would have never imagined I would have gotten this far when I first started learning to program. I often had a hard time believing I could do it. Though I always seem to prove myself wrong through shear perseverance. 

What also helps me is remembering what a Silicon Valley entrepreneur once told me. One time I was at work at night on a weekend. I had been working at a prominent tech company in Palo Alto called Palantir for 5 years. It just so happened that one of the co-founders was hanging around after a workout. The last time I had an actual conversation with him besides the usual hello was 5 years ago during my interview. He asks  what I am doing now at Palantir. I tell him I am still in Operations, but I am thinking about doing something more technical. I tell him that I am learning programming. I tell him that this is probably my third time trying to understand Python and I just now feel like I'm starting to get it. He tells me that when he first started learning he had this textbook. I think he said it was Javascript or something of the like. Anyways, he tells me he read it 5 times. He said the books binding started getting in such bad shape that he started having to tape it together. This is someone who I held high regard. Those kind of people you put a label on in your head in the genius category. You put them there not cause you actually know that they are a genius by some measure besides that they did something amazing. Being a co-founder of a company with a $20+ Billion valuation counted for me as genius status in my mind's categorization system. What that told me, what stuck with me, was that it wasn't like he read the book once and immediately knew everything he needed to know. No, he needed to go over it, over and over again. When he told me that, I didn't feel so bad about how long it's taking me to learn programming. It's not easy, not even for the "geniuses".

## Goals

Right now I still have a lot to learn in my current career as an Operations Manager. Though after another year or two I feel like I will have pretty much understood what problems that Operations Manager's face from employee 1 to 2,000. I believe I will be hungry to move on to something else.

I want to...

1. Build a cool resume site.
2. Feel confident enough to do a redesign of my current companies webpage to be more friendly to a very diverse group of people as well as making it just more fun and welcoming in general.
3. Build a web page and/or mobile app from scratch that serves a purpose that someone other than myself finds valuable.
4. Get hired as a Software Developer.
5. Someday start a company of my own.
